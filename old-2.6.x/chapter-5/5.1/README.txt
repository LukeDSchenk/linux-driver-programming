I have separated chapter 5 section 1 into its own folder here, because it explains a method of using the proc interface that seems to not be the preferred method of doing it. All of the newer examples I have found seem to prefer using the standard filesytem method (using inodes like with our device file examples). This section has been rather frustrating and crash friendly for me, so I am going to skip it for now and see if I have better luck with the next sections.
