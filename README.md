# linux-driver-programming

A repository of some notes and code samples as I read and work through [The Linux Kernel Module Programming Guide](https://github.com/sysprog21/lkmpg).

## Old Version

Initially, I was working through the [original book](https://tldp.org/LDP/lkmpg/2.6/html/index.html) as it was written, but I was pointed towards an updated version with code that works for version 5.x kernels. Thanks to [@jserv](https://github.com/jserv) for showing me the updated version on Github!
